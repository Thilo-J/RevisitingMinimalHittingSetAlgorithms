# Revisiting Minimal Hitting Set Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of four Mininal Hitting Set Algorithms.
Berge, BZ, BZU and BZU*.

To compile use the c++20 standard.

```bash
g++ *.cpp -std=c++20 -o main
```

To run BZ with input file win100.csv and resulting MHSes in out.csv
```bash
./main BZ win100.csv out.csv
```
